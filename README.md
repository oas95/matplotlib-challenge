Analysis
- Total amount of mice before analysis and after duplicate removal is 248. According to the pie chart 51% of the mice are Male and 49% are female.
- The bar graph shows the amount of mice that are in each treatment group.
- The box plot visually represents the final tumor volume distributions between Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Cerftamin.
- The correlation(0.84)and regression analysis (r2 = 0.709) provides good evidence in that as the weight of the mice increase so does the average tumor volume(mm3).
